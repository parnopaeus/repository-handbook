# The Repository Handbook
This is the University of Pittsburgh's application of Cornell's Repository Handbook for our local repository use. 

# What is it?
We are using [Cornell's Repository Handbook](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/Cornell+University+Library+Repository+Principles+and+Strategies+Handbook ) to update our instutitutional repository policies and processes at the Unviersity of Pittsburgh. 

We are working from the [Blank Slate version of the Cornell Handbook] (https://github.com/DSSatPitt/repository-handbook), and this version contains Pitt-specific information. 

# Who is in charge?
